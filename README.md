# zipcodeProject

Objective:
    Process sequentially a CVS file using a buffer class.

Requirements:
1. Create a CSV (comma separated) file from a XLSX file.
2. Write a buffer class which can read and unpack a Zip Code Record from the Zip Code CSV file.
3. Write an application program using those functions/methods that:
1. uses the CSV data file to generate {directed to standard output} a table comprising an alphabetical listing of state (two character) IDs, one state per row, where for each row the Northernmost (greatest latitude), Southernmost, Easternmost (least longitude), and Westernmost Zip Code in that state is listed, in that order.
2. {Precede the table with an appropriate header row displaying labels describing each column.}
4. Document (extensively) your C++ source code with comments and Doxygen tags.
5. Create a Doxygen PDF of your buffer class and application program code.
